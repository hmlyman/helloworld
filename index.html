            <p>Welcome to my webpage! In this webpage, you'll find out everything
               you never wanted to know about me! To start, I'm from Texas and
               attended Texas A&M University where I received a Bachelor's degree.
               I met my husband in college and we married just before I graduated.
               We have three kids and have moved 16 different times to many different
               states. I have definitely not loved every state we've lived in, but
               the experiences and people we've met have made it all worth it.
            </p>
            <p>
                My kids are all going to school this year and it has made me switch
               gears to find what I want to do as a career for the rest of my life.
               Because of the job security and interesting premise, I felt the tech
               industry would be a great field to get into. I also think it's important
               for my kids to understand and be interested in tech. Hopefully they will
               be able to glean some of that from me.
               I agree with Vincent Cerf when he said,
               <br>
               <q>I just am a huge cheerleader for getting kids interested in
                science and technology.</q>

               My main hurdle is to make my brain think more logically than it does.
               Unfortunately, my brain is <em>quite</em> far from logical thinking.
               I can definitely understand and appreciate logic, and I love it. However
               it is not my brain's default. That being said,
                <br>
               <strong>I'm excited to push my brain to new limits!</strong>
