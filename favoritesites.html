            <p>
                I really enjoy <em>stories.</em> I love to listen to people tell stories,
                <br>
                watch them play out on screens, and write them.
                <br>
                This brings me to my list of favorite sites. They are all based on
                <br>
                watching or listening to different stories. I know it may sound
                <br>
                like I'm an 80 year old woman "watching my stories" on TV,
                <br>
                but it really is the story aspect that pulls me in. It isn't important
                <br>
                to me to have optimal screen sizes or resolutions. I really just want to
                <br>
                know what happens. Therefore, my favorite sites to visit are as follows:
