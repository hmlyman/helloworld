            <p>
                I don't plan too far in advance. We used to move to different
                <br>
                states every 6 months or so for my husband's job, so planning too
                <br>
                far in advance was pointless. We now live in Utah for the forseeable
                <br>
                future which is quite nice. Since I still hesitate to plan too far in
                <br>
                advance, I have a few ideas of what I would like to accomplish in
                <br>
                the future. Most of those ideas relate to this class and future career
                <br>
                paths stemming from succeeding in this course.
                <br>
                My future plans are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully complete this program</li>
                <li>Find a career in the tech industry</li>
                <li>Purchase a home with my family</li>
                <li>Raise healthy, happy kids</li>
                <li>Maybe vacation sometimes</li>
                <li>Maybe vacation with kids sometimes</li>
                <li>Continue to be a taxi for my children</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>
                If I can successfully complete all of these plans, I plan
                <br>
                to dance happily.
