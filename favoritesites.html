            <p>
                I really enjoy <em>stories.</em> I love to listen to people tell stories,
                <br>
                watch them play out on screens, and write them.
                <br>
                This brings me to my list of favorite sites. They are all based on
                <br>
                watching or listening to different stories. I know it may sound
                <br>
                like I'm an 80 year old woman "watching my stories" on TV,
                <br>
                but it really is the story aspect that pulls me in. It isn't important
                <br>
                to me to have optimal screen sizes or resolutions. I really just want to
                <br>
                know what happens. Therefore, my favorite sites to visit are as follows:

            <p>
                I am often listening to books from audible while hiking or running or
                <br>
                cleaning my house. It keeps my brain busy and thinking outside of its 
                <br>
                comfort zone. I also really like TV. I grew up watching a ton of TV, 
                <br>
                because <q>screen time</q> wasn't a thing yet. It's how I relax... unless
                <br>
                it's a scary show. Then it's how I stay up all night imagining the worst
                <br>
                possible scenarios that could happen while I sleep. Super fun.
