            <p>Welcome to my webpage! In this webpage, you'll find out everything
                <br>
               you never wanted to know about me! To start, I'm from Texas and
               <br>
               attended Texas A&M University where I received a Bachelor's degree.
               <br>
               I met my husband in college and we married just before I graduated.
               <br>
               We have three kids and have moved 16 different times to many different
               <br>
               states. I have definitely not loved every state we've lived in, but
               <br>
               the experiences and people we've met have made it all worth it.
               <br> 
               My kids are all going to school this year and it has made me switch
               <br>
               gears to find what I want to do as a career for the rest of my life.
               <br>
               Because of the job security and interesting premise, I felt the tech
               <br>
               industry would be a great field to get into. My main hurdle is to make
               <br>
               my brain think more logically than it does.
