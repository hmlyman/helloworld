                I really enjoy <em>stories.</em> I love to listen to people tell stories,
                <br>
                watch them play out on screens, and write them.

                to me to have optimal screen sizes or resolutions. I really just want to
                <br>
                know what happens. Therefore, my favorite sites to visit are as follows:
