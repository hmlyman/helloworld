                I have many interests that change often.
                I have lived in many states and have created
                a table that depicts my favorite activities
                per a few of the states I've lived.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr class="table-title">
                    <th>Activity</th>
                    <th>State</th>
                    <th>Picture</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Running</th>
                    <th>Alabama</th>
                    <th><img src="./assets/images/hooveralabama.png" title="Hoover Alabama" alt="Hoover Alabama"/></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Hiking</th>
                    <th>Utah</th>
                    <th><img src="./assets/images/utah.png" title="Utah" alt="Utah"/></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Mexican Food</th>
                    <th>Texas</th>
                    <th><img src="./assets/images/pappasitos.png" title="Pappasitos" alt="Pappasitos"/></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tourist Attractions</th>
                    <th>Florida</th>
                    <th><img src="./assets/images/PlanetHollywood.png" title="Planet Hollywood" alt="Planet Hollywood"/> </th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                My interests definitely change with my location, but
                that doesn't mean I don't dream about delicious
                Mexican food once a week since living in Utah.
                The other day I went to Chili's... <em>Chili's</em>
                for chips and salsa. And it was amazing. But in Texas
                Chili's chips and salsa would be a last resort.
                Actually, that's probably not true. Chili's does have
                pretty good chips and salsa. Or I've been away from
                Texas for too long. I don't miss the humidity, lack of 
                seasons, or unbearable heat of Texas, but I miss the food.
                That being said, when I'm in Texas, I miss Utah's food.
                And genuinely nothing can top the glorious fried food
                of Louisiana. Hush puppies are the best.
                <br>
                Maybe I should have put food as all of my interests.
